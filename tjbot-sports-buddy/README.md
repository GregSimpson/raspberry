# Build a TJBot using Watson Services to talk about sports

In this developer journey we will build a TJBot that knows baseball. Using 
Watson Discovery, TJBot will give you insight about your favorite teams, such as
their current league standing, their upcoming shedule, and links to a few
relevant articles from Watson News.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Build a TJBot that converses using Watson Conversation
* Use Watson Text to Speech and Speech to Text services to converse with TJBot
* Use Watson Tone Analyzer to determine your sentiment about your favorite teams
* Use Watson Discovery News to find news articles about your favorite teams 
* Query 3rd party data sources to get the latest Major League Baseball (MLB) data
* Use Twilio to send SMS text messages with team schedules and news article links

# Steps

This app is designed to be run on a TJBot, but it can work on any standard workstation
or laptop that supports audio controls - specifically a microphone input device and an 
output speaker. It may be simplier to first get this working on your laptop. If you 
would like to go directly to building this on a TJBot, jump to the section entitled
[Build a TJBot](#build-a-tjbot) before completing the following steps.
